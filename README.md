# Timeline

A front-end JavaScript library (written in TypeScript) for building graphical timelines with Raphael.

> This library is based on the [Chronoline.JS](https://github.com/StoicLoofah/chronoline.js) library. Several pull requests have been made to that library to add functionality, but there was a need to rewrite the library in modern JavaScript.
